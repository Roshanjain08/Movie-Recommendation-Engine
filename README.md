# Movie Recommendation Engine

## Project Overview

This project is designed to immerse data scientists in the standard data science toolkits, with an emphasis on NumPy and Pandas for data processing and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization. We explore the multifaceted nature of data science problems, demonstrating how they can be represented and analyzed from various angles.
We developed a movie recommendation engine for a streaming service provider, through collaborative filtering techniques such as user-user, item-item, and matrix factorization in Python with Pandas and Numpy.
Analyzed dataset sparsity, optimized data representation using sparse matrix to reduce storage, ensuring high runtime efficiency

## Objectives
